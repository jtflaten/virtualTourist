Virtual Tourist is an app made in fulfillment of my udacity iOS Nanodegree.

The app showcases my ability to use CoreData, as well as my ability to network to RESTful APIs (specifically
Flickr's API). The app allows users to place a pin on the the map, and will access flickr to find images
that are registered near that region. the pins and image catalogs are persisted with coredata.

This app was done as an assignment for my Udacity iOS nanodegree. there are many
apps like it out there.(you van probably find some on github) but the codebase and
storyboards were all started from scratch. You can find info on the project
specifcations at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-UIi1jJGuNWKoEjEk09wwYf4ebefnwcVrUYbiHh1MI/pub?embedded=true

Thanks for checking it out!
